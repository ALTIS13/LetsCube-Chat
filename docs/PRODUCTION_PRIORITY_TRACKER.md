# LETSCUBE Production Priority Tracker

Status: active production-hardening tracker, updated 2026-06-22.

This file is the working source of truth for the next production stages. Before starting any new production task, read this file first, then update the relevant checkboxes/status when work is completed, blocked, or intentionally deferred.

Legend:

- `[x]` done and covered by regression checks.
- `[~]` active stage.
- `[ ]` pending.
- `[!]` blocked or deferred by an external dependency.

## Current Execution Order

1. `[x]` Priority 1 - Auth and anti-abuse baseline.
2. `[x]` Priority 2 - RLS and security audit baseline.
3. `[!]` Priority 3 - Backup and restore drill follow-ups.
4. `[x]` Priority 4 - Operator security observability.
5. `[~]` Priority 5 - Installed web/PWA production shell.
6. `[!]` Priority 6 - Monitoring and self-hosted Sentry.
7. `[!]` Deferred native/mobile packaging and native push.

## Last Confirmed Deploy Baseline

- GitHub `main`: `1dd8f8c263f284c5ee45906d206d95e6ab75e2b2`.
- Coolify app: `letscube-web`.
- Public app: `https://app.letscube.ru`.
- Auto deploy: GitHub webhook to Coolify was restored; test push queued and completed with `is_webhook=t`.
- Self-host stack: Coolify, self-hosted Supabase, Mailcow, Caddy, and app deployment are already in place.

## Completed Baseline - Do Not Rebuild Without A New Finding

- `[x]` Self-host migration foundation: app, Supabase, Storage/media, mail delivery, and Coolify deployment moved to the server.
- `[x]` Docker subnet conflict with hoster gateway identified and avoided by custom Docker address pools.
- `[x]` Mail delivery baseline: Mailcow DNS, DKIM, PTR, external smoke, Supabase recovery email delivery and branded recovery template.
- `[x]` Auth copy: signup and recovery messages are generic and do not reveal account existence.
- `[x]` Password recovery route and UI flow work with self-hosted mail.
- `[x]` Existing-account signup cannot be used to obtain access to an existing user account.
- `[x]` Yandex SmartCaptcha gateway protects signup and recovery.
- `[x]` Direct public signup/recovery bypass paths are blocked at the proxy layer.
- `[x]` Auth gateway has in-function rate limiting before CAPTCHA/Auth calls.
- `[x]` Login token endpoint HTTP 429 maps to friendly Russian UI copy.
- `[x]` Invite code/link flow exists, with invite-only mode controlled from the admin panel.
- `[x]` Invite code field is hidden when invite-only mode is off; preconfigured invite links apply role/club in the background.
- `[x]` Reserved admin-like usernames are blocked for non-admin users.
- `[x]` RLS smoke and anon REST probes exist and cover authenticated/anonymous boundaries.
- `[x]` Group invite non-member hardening proposal was applied manually after explicit approval.
- `[x]` Notification center tabs and grouping are in place.
- `[x]` Message notification read-sync/grouping baseline is in place.
- `[x]` Chat scroll anchoring baseline: no unread -> bottom, unread -> first unread, search/notification jumps preserved.
- `[x]` LETSCUBE visual cleanup: auth branding, duplicate sidebar logo, mascot placement, and visible KUB/KUB text cleanup are done.

## Priority 1 - Auth And Anti-Abuse

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: public auth endpoints must not allow bot signup, password guessing, recovery abuse, or CAPTCHA bypass.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` Signup and recovery go through the Yandex SmartCaptcha auth gateway in the public app.
- `[x]` Direct public bypass paths to sensitive Supabase Auth endpoints are blocked or rate limited at the proxy layer.
- `[x]` Login, signup, recovery, verify, resend and token endpoints have server-side throttling or gateway protections.
- `[x]` User-facing auth errors do not reveal whether an account exists.
- `[x]` Existing users cannot obtain a session through the registration screen.
- `[x]` 429/rate-limit errors map to friendly Russian UI copy.
- `[x]` Auth abuse checks have repeatable smoke tests and operational verification commands.

Keep checking:

- `[ ]` Run gateway/no-direct-auth Playwright checks when CAPTCHA env is enabled.
- `[ ]` Add an operator-facing auth anti-abuse smoke script if repeated manual curl checks become noisy.
- `[ ]` Revisit stronger account creation controls only if abuse continues despite CAPTCHA/rate limits/invite mode.

## Priority 2 - RLS And Security Audit

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: authenticated users can only read/write rows, objects and RPC effects allowed by membership, role, location and task permissions.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` All inspected exposed public tables have RLS enabled.
- `[x]` Public views are absent or use `security_invoker` / restricted grants.
- `[x]` Anonymous REST exposure checks exist.
- `[x]` Authenticated role boundary checks exist.
- `[x]` Storage policies for media, avatars and task attachments are path-scoped and role-aware.
- `[x]` SECURITY DEFINER function hardening is tracked through proposals when needed.

Keep checking:

- `[ ]` Run `pnpm.cmd rls:anon-rest` in security-stage validation.
- `[ ]` Run `pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` in security-stage validation.
- `[ ]` Run `KUB_QA_ALLOW_MUTATIONS=1 pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` only when mutation fixture validation is needed.
- `[ ]` Create new SQL proposals only for concrete drift or a verified gap.

## Priority 3 - Backup And Restore Drill

Status: `[!]` follow-ups deferred by user on 2026-06-22.

Goal: a full LETSCUBE production restore must be executable from backups without relying on memory or ad hoc commands.

Guardrails:

- No SQL changes in this stage unless explicitly requested.
- No restore into production.
- No destructive remote cleanup during inventory.
- No env, token, database password, SMTP password, or secret contents in repo/docs/logs.
- Restore rehearsal must use an isolated temporary target.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` P3.1 Read current backup status and runbooks before making changes.
- `[x]` P3.2 Record read-only live inventory: backup directories, scripts, timers, cron, Docker volumes, Supabase/Mailcow/Coolify config locations.
- `[x]` P3.3 Confirm Postgres logical backup command and retention policy.
- `[x]` P3.4 Confirm Supabase Storage/media backup command and retention policy.
- `[x]` P3.5 Confirm Coolify, Mailcow, Caddy, Supabase compose/env/config, and ops docs are backed up without exposing secret values.
- `[x]` P3.6 Add or update backup scripts only if missing, idempotent, and secret-safe. Existing scripts are present; no script update was needed during this inventory pass.
- `[x]` P3.7 Run non-destructive backup verification: archive listing, metadata checks, row/object counts where safe.
- `[!]` P3.8 Prepare isolated restore target plan and get explicit approval before any restore. Deferred.
- `[!]` P3.9 Rehearse restore into isolated target. Deferred.
- `[!]` P3.10 Verify restore: row counts, key tables, Storage object counts, basic app smoke. Deferred.
- `[x]` P3.11 Decide and document temporary off-server/offsite backup destination. Temporary target is a private GitHub repository with client-side encrypted chunks; permanent backup storage remains a later replacement.

Current baseline:

- Infrastructure docs describe backup/restore expectations.
- Self-host migration placed operational files under `/srv/letscube`.
- Server backup inventory and non-destructive verification are recorded in `docs/infra/BACKUP_RESTORE_STATUS_20260622.md`.
- Latest verified local backup set: `/srv/letscube/backups/automated/20260622-034450`.
- Latest backup checksum verification: passed.
- Temporary GitHub offsite backup is configured and encrypted before upload.
- GitHub offsite target: private repository `ALTIS13/letscube-encrypted-backups`.
- Server upload script: `/srv/letscube/scripts/letscube-github-offsite-backup.sh`.
- Server timer: `letscube-github-offsite-backup.timer`.
- Latest controlled GitHub offsite sync: completed for `/srv/letscube/backups/automated/20260622-034450`.

Next action:

- `[!]` Monitor the first scheduled GitHub offsite timer run on 2026-06-23. Deferred by user.
- `[!]` Replace temporary GitHub storage with a dedicated backup target (`rclone`, `restic`, or `borg`) when available. Deferred until backup environment is ready.
- `[!]` Prepare an isolated restore target plan and get explicit approval before any restore. Deferred.

## Priority 4 - Operator Security Observability

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: make auth abuse, invite-code abuse, and suspicious registration/login patterns visible to operators without leaking sensitive data.

Candidate work:

- `[x]` Add or document an operator smoke command for auth gateway rate limits and direct-auth bypass checks.
- `[x]` Add an admin-facing or ops-facing view/report for recent auth/invite security aggregates if product-safe.
- `[x]` Ensure reports do not show raw secrets, passwords, CAPTCHA tokens, recovery tokens, or full IP data unless explicitly approved.
- `[x]` Keep this separate from CAPTCHA/rate-limit implementation unless new gaps are found.

Current baseline:

- Operator smoke script: `scripts/auth-anti-abuse-smoke.mjs`.
- Package command: `pnpm.cmd auth:anti-abuse:smoke`.
- Runbook: `docs/security/AUTH_OPERATOR_SMOKE.md`.
- Default smoke checks direct `/auth/v1/signup` and `/auth/v1/recover` protection without creating users.
- Default smoke checks `auth-yandex-gateway` signup/recovery no-CAPTCHA handling.
- Repeated gateway rate-limit stress is opt-in through `--stress-rate-limit` or `KUB_AUTH_SMOKE_STRESS_RATE_LIMIT=1`.
- 2026-06-22 live smoke result: direct signup/recovery returned 403, gateway no-CAPTCHA returned `captcha_required`, opt-in stress observed 429 `rate_limited` on repeated gateway attempts.
- Admin/Ops report UI: `/admin/ops`.
- Admin/Ops report runbook: `docs/security/ADMIN_OPS_REPORT.md`.
- Admin/Ops report SQL proposal: `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260622_admin_ops_security_report.sql`.
- SQL was not applied automatically. Until the RPC is applied, `/admin/ops` shows a friendly migration warning and still displays frontend protection status.
- The report intentionally returns aggregate counts and sanitized invite/auth event labels only; it does not show email, IP, password, CAPTCHA/recovery/push tokens, actor IDs, or target IDs.

## Priority 5 - Installed Web/PWA Production Shell

Status: `[~]` active next stage after Priority 4.

Goal: ship the web/PWA path as the production app experience while APK/native work remains deferred.

Scope:

- `[ ]` Verify installed PWA window on desktop/mobile without browser chrome where the platform supports it.
- `[ ]` Verify browser/PWA push delivery, grouping, notification click routing, and read-sync.
- `[ ]` Verify iOS/Android home-screen/install behavior and document platform limitations.
- `[ ]` Preserve full messenger functionality: auth, chats, media, camera, voice, video-circle, tasks, search, notifications.
- `[ ]` Keep native APK/FCM/release signing out of this stage.

## Priority 6 - Monitoring And Self-Hosted Sentry

Status: `[!]` deferred until backup/restore baseline is safe.

Goal: add production monitoring without relying on foreign unstable SaaS paths.

Candidate work:

- `[ ]` Deploy self-hosted Sentry or a lighter local monitoring alternative.
- `[ ]` Verify error capture from frontend and Edge Functions without secrets/message content/media URLs.
- `[ ]` Add uptime and synthetic checks for app, Supabase, mail, and Coolify.
- `[ ]` Add backup job failure alerts.

## Deferred Native/Mobile Work

Status: `[!]` intentionally deferred.

- `[!]` APK/native app packaging.
- `[!]` Native Android FCM push.
- `[!]` Release signing/AAB.
- `[!]` Deep links/app links.
- `[!]` SMS provider rollout.

Standalone web/PWA remains the production app path for now. The app should behave like an installed messenger tab without browser chrome where the platform supports installed PWAs.

## Default Validation Commands

Run only the commands relevant to the touched area, but prefer this baseline before commit/push:

- `git diff --check`
- `pnpm.cmd --filter @workspace/kub run typecheck`
- `cmd /c "set PORT=5173&& set BASE_PATH=/&& pnpm.cmd --filter @workspace/kub run build"`
- `pnpm.cmd e2e:smoke` when frontend behavior changed.
- `pnpm.cmd db:types:check` when schema/types/database code changed.
- `pnpm.cmd rls:anon-rest` and `pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` during RLS/security stages.

Known validation notes:

- Vite sourcemap/chunk-size warnings may exist and are not automatically blocking unless new.
- `db:types:check` may report known advisory drift around message media fields/search RPCs/notification outbox until those are separately resolved.

## Security Guardrails For Every Stage

- No credentials, env values, access tokens, DB passwords, SMTP passwords, Firebase keys, CAPTCHA server keys, or service-role keys in git/docs/output.
- No `service_role` in frontend/public/mobile bundles.
- No `google-services.json`, keystores, or signing secrets in git.
- No SQL apply without explicit user approval.
- No production restore, destructive cleanup, or broad firewall/network changes without explicit user approval.
- Use focused diffs and record validation results.
