# LETSCUBE Production Priority Tracker

Status: active production-hardening tracker, updated 2026-07-09.

This file is the working source of truth for the next production stages. Before starting any new production task, read this file first, then update the relevant checkboxes/status when work is completed, blocked, or intentionally deferred.

Legend:

- `[x]` done and covered by regression checks.
- `[~]` active stage.
- `[ ]` pending.
- `[!]` blocked or deferred by an external dependency.

## Current Execution Order

1. `[x]` Priority 1 - Auth and anti-abuse baseline.
2. `[x]` Priority 2 - RLS and security audit baseline.
3. `[!]` Priority 3 - Backup and restore drill follow-ups.
4. `[x]` Priority 4 - Operator security observability.
5. `[~]` Priority 5 - Installed web/PWA production shell.
6. `[!]` Priority 6 - Monitoring and self-hosted Sentry.
7. `[~]` Native/mobile packaging resumed: Android release candidate first, then Windows Electron capability spike and EXE packaging.

## Next Execution Queue

Use this queue before starting the next production-hardening turn. Do not repeat completed items unless a new bug report or regression test proves the old fix is insufficient.

1. `[x]` Fix Coolify worker auto-deploy gap so `letscube-worker` updates automatically when worker/backend code changes. Verified on 2026-06-23: push `56ac76e` created worker deployment `l9ca22g6e83fkn2psv6cc8lx` with `is_webhook=true` and status `finished`. Worker `watch_paths` now limit deploys to `artifacts/api-server`, Docker/deploy files and workspace dependency manifests so docs-only commits do not redeploy the worker. GitHub Actions are intentionally disabled and workflow files were removed; Coolify webhooks are the deployment path.
2. `[~]` Continue chat performance audit and synchronization hardening. Current known findings:
   - `[x]` Composer text is cleared immediately after optimistic send instead of waiting for delivery/read checks.
   - `[x]` Fully read chat opens anchored to latest messages.
   - `[x]` Chat with unread messages opens near the first unread boundary.
   - `[x]` Chat info media gallery uses generated variants instead of original media files for tiles.
   - `[x]` Reproduce and fix fast upward history scrolling bug: when the user quickly scrolls up through older messages, the message list no longer jumps back to the newest/bottom position during initial bottom settling.
   - `[x]` Prevent older-history auto-prepend from racing initial chat open anchoring: the top-of-list loader is disabled until the initial unread/bottom scroll has been applied, so read chats do not silently open on an older slice.
   - `[x]` Keep the sent message visible in the sidebar immediately through the optimistic store update and reconcile it with the realtime echo by `client_message_id` (`a458cd9`).
   - `[x]` Reopen a recently visited PWA chat from cached messages without an empty loading loop, then reconcile in the background (`f2c6673`).
   - `[x]` Hydrate chat/sender metadata before completing push navigation so a slow PWA resume does not stay on the generic `Чат` fallback (`f2c6673`).
   - `[x]` Add proposal-only batched sidebar summaries RPC and a frontend compatibility path. The RPC reduces last-message/unread loading from approximately `2 + 3N` requests to three batch requests while remaining `SECURITY INVOKER` and RLS-aware.
   - `[x]` Applied `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260709_chat_list_summaries.sql` manually on 2026-07-09 after a verified full database backup. All 10 users with chat memberships matched the legacy unread/preview semantics, anonymous RPC access is denied, authenticated REST and production frontend calls return `200`, and `VITE_CHAT_LIST_SUMMARIES_RPC_ENABLED=1` is active in the healthy web deployment.
   - `[x]` Measured the active batch RPC and large-history rendering in production on 2026-07-10 with `owner`, `tech_admin`, `location_staff` and `client` QA accounts at 1440x900 and 390x844. For the 246-message history, cold sidebar readiness was 505-564 ms, summary RPC was 47-55 ms, first 100 messages rendered in 452-467 ms, and warm reopen was 174-200 ms. Loading the remaining 146 messages took two 642-757 ms prepend pages without returning to the bottom; scroll-anchor error was 0 px desktop and at most 42 px mobile.
   - `[x]` Replaced the startup permission fan-out with one authenticated access snapshot. `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260710_current_user_access_snapshot.sql` was applied manually on 2026-07-11 after verified backup `/srv/letscube/backups/pre-migrations/20260711-105607-before-access-snapshot.dump`. Full parity covered all 12 profiles with zero global-role, global-permission or location-permission mismatches. `anon` has no execute grant, `authenticated` does. `VITE_ACCESS_SNAPSHOT_RPC_ENABLED=1` is active in production; live Playwright observed exactly one `current_user_access_snapshot` request and zero legacy `has_permission`, `has_location_permission` or `has_global_role` requests.
3. `[ ]` Add 720p video transcode worker path and upload quality selection after ffmpeg CPU/runtime sizing and load testing.
4. `[ ]` Add media upload progress, retry and resume UX for large files.
5. `[ ]` Run installed web/PWA production QA on desktop, iPhone/iOS home-screen and Android browser home-screen; keep APK/native push deferred.
6. `[!]` Keep monitoring/Sentry and backup restore rehearsal deferred until the user confirms the backup environment and restore-test window.
7. `[~]` Complete the Capacitor Android release candidate. LETSCUBE adaptive icons, dark splash resources and the `0.1.0` version baseline are generated and the debug APK builds. Remaining: physical branding QA, FCM, internal routing, signing and internal AAB/APK QA.
8. `[ ]` After Android RC, run an Electron capability spike and package an internal Windows NSIS setup executable.

## Last Confirmed Deploy Baseline

- GitHub `main`: `2bee4ec0a66553976ebfdd44cbedbb70983c896e` (access snapshot rollout QA baseline).
- Coolify app: `letscube-web`.
- Public app: `https://app.letscube.ru`.
- Auto deploy: GitHub webhook to Coolify is active for `letscube-web`; deployment `slnhfpzay5c3n80fbxgsz00a` completed commit `2bee4ec` successfully. The chat-summary and access-snapshot RPC build flags are enabled; web and worker remain `running:healthy`.
- Worker auto deploy: worker-specific GitHub webhook is verified. Push `56ac76e` created `letscube-worker` deployment `l9ca22g6e83fkn2psv6cc8lx` with `is_webhook=true` and status `finished`. Worker `watch_paths` are configured for worker/build/runtime paths only. GitHub Actions are intentionally disabled and repo workflow files/secrets were removed to avoid billing-lock email noise.
- Self-host stack: Coolify proxy, self-hosted Supabase, Mailcow, app and worker deployment are already in place.
- Production domains verified on 2026-07-09: `app.letscube.ru`, `deploy.letscube.ru`, `core.letscube.ru`, `mailserver.letscube.ru`, `notify.letscube.ru`, and SSH host `ms.letscube.ru` resolve and expose their expected services with valid TLS where applicable.
- `api.letscube.ru`, `status.letscube.ru`, and `monitor.letscube.ru` currently resolve to the server but have no HTTPS service behind them. Treat them as reserved future endpoints, not active dependencies.
- The installed Supabase MCP connector still targets the legacy cloud project. Production self-host checks must use `core.letscube.ru`, the local secret-safe env file, or read-only SSH/database inspection.

## Completed Baseline - Do Not Rebuild Without A New Finding

- `[x]` Self-host migration foundation: app, Supabase, Storage/media, mail delivery, and Coolify deployment moved to the server.
- `[x]` Docker subnet conflict with hoster gateway identified and avoided by custom Docker address pools.
- `[x]` Mail delivery baseline: Mailcow DNS, DKIM, PTR, external smoke, Supabase recovery email delivery and branded recovery template.
- `[x]` Auth copy: signup and recovery messages are generic and do not reveal account existence.
- `[x]` Password recovery route and UI flow work with self-hosted mail.
- `[x]` Existing-account signup cannot be used to obtain access to an existing user account.
- `[x]` Yandex SmartCaptcha gateway protects signup and recovery.
- `[x]` Direct public signup/recovery bypass paths are blocked at the proxy layer.
- `[x]` Auth gateway has in-function rate limiting before CAPTCHA/Auth calls.
- `[x]` Login token endpoint HTTP 429 maps to friendly Russian UI copy.
- `[x]` Invite code/link flow exists, with invite-only mode controlled from the admin panel.
- `[x]` Invite code field is hidden when invite-only mode is off; preconfigured invite links apply role/club in the background.
- `[x]` Reserved admin-like usernames are blocked for non-admin users.
- `[x]` RLS smoke and anon REST probes exist and cover authenticated/anonymous boundaries.
- `[x]` Group invite non-member hardening proposal was applied manually after explicit approval.
- `[x]` Notification center tabs and grouping are in place.
- `[x]` Message notification read-sync/grouping baseline is in place.
- `[x]` Chat scroll anchoring baseline: no unread -> bottom, unread -> first unread, search/notification jumps preserved.
- `[x]` LETSCUBE visual cleanup: auth branding, duplicate sidebar logo, mascot placement, and visible KUB/KUB text cleanup are done.

## Priority 1 - Auth And Anti-Abuse

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: public auth endpoints must not allow bot signup, password guessing, recovery abuse, or CAPTCHA bypass.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` Signup and recovery go through the Yandex SmartCaptcha auth gateway in the public app.
- `[x]` Direct public bypass paths to sensitive Supabase Auth endpoints are blocked or rate limited at the proxy layer.
- `[x]` Login, signup, recovery, verify, resend and token endpoints have server-side throttling or gateway protections.
- `[x]` User-facing auth errors do not reveal whether an account exists.
- `[x]` Existing users cannot obtain a session through the registration screen.
- `[x]` 429/rate-limit errors map to friendly Russian UI copy.
- `[x]` Auth abuse checks have repeatable smoke tests and operational verification commands.

Keep checking:

- `[ ]` Run gateway/no-direct-auth Playwright checks when CAPTCHA env is enabled.
- `[ ]` Add an operator-facing auth anti-abuse smoke script if repeated manual curl checks become noisy.
- `[ ]` Revisit stronger account creation controls only if abuse continues despite CAPTCHA/rate limits/invite mode.

## Priority 2 - RLS And Security Audit

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: authenticated users can only read/write rows, objects and RPC effects allowed by membership, role, location and task permissions.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` All inspected exposed public tables have RLS enabled.
- `[x]` Public views are absent or use `security_invoker` / restricted grants.
- `[x]` Anonymous REST exposure checks exist.
- `[x]` Authenticated role boundary checks exist.
- `[x]` Storage policies for media, avatars and task attachments are path-scoped and role-aware.
- `[x]` SECURITY DEFINER function hardening is tracked through proposals when needed.

Keep checking:

- `[ ]` Run `pnpm.cmd rls:anon-rest` in security-stage validation.
- `[ ]` Run `pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` in security-stage validation.
- `[ ]` Run `KUB_QA_ALLOW_MUTATIONS=1 pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` only when mutation fixture validation is needed.
- `[ ]` Create new SQL proposals only for concrete drift or a verified gap.

## Priority 3 - Backup And Restore Drill

Status: `[!]` follow-ups deferred by user on 2026-06-22.

Goal: a full LETSCUBE production restore must be executable from backups without relying on memory or ad hoc commands.

Guardrails:

- No SQL changes in this stage unless explicitly requested.
- No restore into production.
- No destructive remote cleanup during inventory.
- No env, token, database password, SMTP password, or secret contents in repo/docs/logs.
- Restore rehearsal must use an isolated temporary target.

Definition of done:

- `[x]` P3.1 Read current backup status and runbooks before making changes.
- `[x]` P3.2 Record read-only live inventory: backup directories, scripts, timers, cron, Docker volumes, Supabase/Mailcow/Coolify config locations.
- `[x]` P3.3 Confirm Postgres logical backup command and retention policy.
- `[x]` P3.4 Confirm Supabase Storage/media backup command and retention policy.
- `[x]` P3.5 Confirm Coolify, Mailcow, Caddy, Supabase compose/env/config, and ops docs are backed up without exposing secret values.
- `[x]` P3.6 Add or update backup scripts only if missing, idempotent, and secret-safe. Existing scripts are present; no script update was needed during this inventory pass.
- `[x]` P3.7 Run non-destructive backup verification: archive listing, metadata checks, row/object counts where safe.
- `[!]` P3.8 Prepare isolated restore target plan and get explicit approval before any restore. Deferred.
- `[!]` P3.9 Rehearse restore into isolated target. Deferred.
- `[!]` P3.10 Verify restore: row counts, key tables, Storage object counts, basic app smoke. Deferred.
- `[x]` P3.11 Decide and document temporary off-server/offsite backup destination. Temporary target is a private GitHub repository with client-side encrypted chunks; permanent backup storage remains a later replacement.

Current baseline:

- Infrastructure docs describe backup/restore expectations.
- Self-host migration placed operational files under `/srv/letscube`.
- Server backup inventory and non-destructive verification are recorded in `docs/infra/BACKUP_RESTORE_STATUS_20260622.md`.
- Latest verified local backup set: `/srv/letscube/backups/automated/20260622-034450`.
- Latest backup checksum verification: passed.
- Temporary GitHub offsite backup is configured and encrypted before upload.
- GitHub offsite target: private repository `ALTIS13/letscube-encrypted-backups`.
- Server upload script: `/srv/letscube/scripts/letscube-github-offsite-backup.sh`.
- Server timer: `letscube-github-offsite-backup.timer`.
- Latest controlled GitHub offsite sync: completed for `/srv/letscube/backups/automated/20260622-034450`.

Next action:

- `[!]` Monitor the first scheduled GitHub offsite timer run on 2026-06-23. Deferred by user.
- `[!]` Replace temporary GitHub storage with a dedicated backup target (`rclone`, `restic`, or `borg`) when available. Deferred until backup environment is ready.
- `[!]` Prepare an isolated restore target plan and get explicit approval before any restore. Deferred.

## Priority 4 - Operator Security Observability

Status: `[x]` baseline complete. Keep as regression guard.

Goal: make auth abuse, invite-code abuse, and suspicious registration/login patterns visible to operators without leaking sensitive data.

Candidate work:

- `[x]` Add or document an operator smoke command for auth gateway rate limits and direct-auth bypass checks.
- `[x]` Add an admin-facing or ops-facing view/report for recent auth/invite security aggregates if product-safe.
- `[x]` Ensure reports do not show raw secrets, passwords, CAPTCHA tokens, recovery tokens, or full IP data unless explicitly approved.
- `[x]` Keep this separate from CAPTCHA/rate-limit implementation unless new gaps are found.

Current baseline:

- Operator smoke script: `scripts/auth-anti-abuse-smoke.mjs`.
- Package command: `pnpm.cmd auth:anti-abuse:smoke`.
- Runbook: `docs/security/AUTH_OPERATOR_SMOKE.md`.
- Default smoke checks direct `/auth/v1/signup` and `/auth/v1/recover` protection without creating users.
- Default smoke checks `auth-yandex-gateway` signup/recovery no-CAPTCHA handling.
- Repeated gateway rate-limit stress is opt-in through `--stress-rate-limit` or `KUB_AUTH_SMOKE_STRESS_RATE_LIMIT=1`.
- 2026-06-22 live smoke result: direct signup/recovery returned 403, gateway no-CAPTCHA returned `captcha_required`, opt-in stress observed 429 `rate_limited` on repeated gateway attempts.
- Admin/Ops report UI: `/admin/ops`.
- Admin/Ops report runbook: `docs/security/ADMIN_OPS_REPORT.md`.
- Admin/Ops report SQL proposal: `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260622_admin_ops_security_report.sql`.
- SQL was not applied automatically. Until the RPC is applied, `/admin/ops` shows a friendly migration warning and still displays frontend protection status.
- The report intentionally returns aggregate counts and sanitized invite/auth event labels only; it does not show email, IP, password, CAPTCHA/recovery/push tokens, actor IDs, or target IDs.

## Priority 5 - Installed Web/PWA Production Shell

Status: `[~]` active. Automated shell/push-contract baseline was refreshed on 2026-06-22; manual installed-window/home-screen checks remain.

Goal: ship the web/PWA path as the production app experience while APK/native work remains deferred.

Scope:

- `[x]` Refresh PWA shell identity: document title, Apple app title, manifest name/short name and install metadata use `LETSCUBE`.
- `[x]` Add platform-aware Settings install state for desktop, Android browser, iPhone/iPad, mobile browser and native Android APK.
- `[x]` Verify PWA manifest, service worker registration, offline/reconnect banner and direct app-shell routes across desktop/mobile Playwright viewports.
- `[x]` Verify browser/PWA push contract: stable notification tags, same-tag close behavior, click routing, and no raw media/token fields in SW payload handling.
- `[ ]` Verify installed PWA window on desktop/mobile without browser chrome where the platform supports it.
- `[ ]` Verify real browser/PWA push delivery and notification click routing against a live installed client.
- `[ ]` Verify iOS/Android home-screen/install behavior and document platform limitations.
- `[ ]` Preserve full messenger functionality: auth, chats, media, camera, voice, video-circle, tasks, search, notifications.
- `[ ]` Keep native APK/FCM/release signing out of this stage.

Current baseline:

- `artifacts/kub/index.html` title and Apple web app title are `LETSCUBE`.
- `artifacts/kub/public/manifest.json` uses `LETSCUBE`, `display: standalone`, and `display_override` fallbacks.
- The iPhone home-screen icon uses a dedicated 180x180 LETSCUBE club asset; 192/512/maskable PWA icons use the same official mark, and the service worker precaches the complete icon set.
- Settings install block shows the detected install variant (`ПК Web/PWA`, `iPhone / iOS PWA`, `Android Web/PWA`, `Android APK`) and opens platform-specific installation guidance when a direct browser prompt is unavailable.
- `tests/e2e/pwa.spec.ts` covers PWA shell metadata, service worker safety, offline/reconnect banner, and SPA direct routes on 1440, 1920, 3840, 390 and 412 viewports.
- `tests/e2e/pwa-install-settings.spec.ts` covers desktop install variant and iPhone Safari home-screen guidance from the Settings install button.
- `tests/e2e/push-phone-foundation.spec.ts` covers push settings layout, phone fallback, SW push grouping/click-routing, native push adapter token hygiene and Android channels on the same viewport matrix.
- Client-side chat media optimization baseline is in place: new image attachments and avatars are bounded before upload when possible; new image/video messages carry dimensions/size metadata for stable bubble layout.

Next media/performance action:

- `[~]` Media variants pipeline:
  - `[x]` Applied `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260622_media_variants_pipeline.sql` to self-host Postgres after a schema backup.
  - `[x]` Added optional server-side `kub-worker` runtime target/service for trusted media processing; frontend still receives no service-role secrets.
  - `[x]` Added image message variants (`image_thumb`, `image_preview`) and user avatar variants (`avatar_128`, `avatar_256`) generation through `artifacts/api-server`.
  - `[x]` Wired frontend read path to prefer ready message image variants and user avatar variants over original media where available. Avatar variants for chat peers need manual application of `.migration-backup/supabase/migrations/20260623_avatar_variants_read_policy.sql`.
  - `[x]` Raised self-host Supabase Storage upload size for `supabase-storage` to 250 MB and verified a 60 MB object upload/delete through the Storage API.
  - `[x]` Added server-side video poster generation (`video_poster`) through the trusted worker and wired chat video bubbles to use ready posters.
  - `[x]` Wired chat info media gallery to use ready image/video variants for tiles instead of loading original media files.
  - `[x]` Reproduced and fixed fast upward scroll jump in long chat history: user wheel/touch/pointer input now cancels initial bottom settling so quick upward scrolling is preserved.
  - `[ ]` Add 720p video transcode worker path and upload quality selection after ffmpeg CPU/runtime sizing and load testing.

## Priority 6 - Monitoring And Self-Hosted Sentry

Status: `[!]` deferred until backup/restore baseline is safe.

Goal: add production monitoring without relying on foreign unstable SaaS paths.

Candidate work:

- `[ ]` Deploy self-hosted Sentry or a lighter local monitoring alternative.
- `[ ]` Verify error capture from frontend and Edge Functions without secrets/message content/media URLs.
- `[ ]` Add uptime and synthetic checks for app, Supabase, mail, and Coolify.
- `[ ]` Add backup job failure alerts.

## Native And Desktop Packaging

Status: `[~]` active. Approved order: shared pre-packaging gate, Android release candidate, then Windows Electron capability spike and packaging.

- `[x]` Production debug APK connection and physical launch: the public build allowlist, LETSCUBE adaptive icons/dark splash, Android `0.1.0` versioning, install and first launch were verified on a Nothing/Spacewar A063 running Android 15.
- `[x]` Native Android FCM foundation: local ignored Firebase client config, Capacitor permission/registration/channels, live auth-scoped device RPCs, RLS-protected device/outbox schema, trusted HTTP v1 delivery and one physical background notification/tap smoke are complete.
- `[~]` Native push release QA: real owner-to-client message delivery, sender exclusion, category preference suppression, same-chat collapse, server-backed chat read-sync, cold-start tap routing, killed-process delivery, separate task delivery, location-staff task routing, restart registration recovery and Android 16 Google Play emulator coverage pass. A second Android 15 Realme device passes APK/portrait UI QA, but its custom-ROM microG cannot complete Google Check-in (`AccountDisabled`); broader FCM coverage still needs another device with official Google Play Services.
- `[ ]` Release signing/AAB with secrets outside Git.
- `[ ]` Android deep links/app links and recovery callback.
- `[ ]` Windows Electron capability spike, NSIS installer, native notifications and self-hosted update channel.
- `[!]` SMS provider rollout.

Standalone web/PWA remains the current production path until the Android and Windows release gates pass. Packaging must reuse the same validated frontend and may not weaken browser/PWA behavior.

## Default Validation Commands

Run only the commands relevant to the touched area, but prefer this baseline before commit/push:

- `git diff --check`
- `pnpm.cmd --filter @workspace/kub run typecheck`
- `cmd /c "set PORT=5173&& set BASE_PATH=/&& pnpm.cmd --filter @workspace/kub run build"`
- `pnpm.cmd e2e:smoke` when frontend behavior changed.
- `pnpm.cmd db:types:check` when schema/types/database code changed.
- `pnpm.cmd rls:anon-rest` and `pnpm.cmd rls:smoke` during RLS/security stages.

Known validation notes:

- Vite sourcemap/chunk-size warnings may exist and are not automatically blocking unless new.
- `db:types:check` may report known advisory drift around message media fields/search RPCs/notification outbox until those are separately resolved.

## Security Guardrails For Every Stage

- No credentials, env values, access tokens, DB passwords, SMTP passwords, Firebase keys, CAPTCHA server keys, or service-role keys in git/docs/output.
- No `service_role` in frontend/public/mobile bundles.
- No `google-services.json`, keystores, or signing secrets in git.
- No SQL apply without explicit user approval.
- No production restore, destructive cleanup, or broad firewall/network changes without explicit user approval.
- Use focused diffs and record validation results.
