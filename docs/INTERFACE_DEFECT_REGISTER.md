# LETSCUBE Interface Defect Register

Deliverable of queue item 18 in `docs/PRODUCTION_PRIORITY_TRACKER.md` — the
interface audit and polish stage.

The stage itself is scheduled after the public home plan closes. This register is
open early because defects were found while capturing the product previews from
the shipping components, and evidence is cheapest to record at the moment it is
observed. Nothing here has been fixed yet: the register is the audit half's
output, and fixes belong to the stage.

Rules for entries: a reproduction, the exact surface with `file:line`, what is
actually wrong, and the observable consequence. No entry without evidence.

Status legend: `[ ]` open, `[~]` fix in progress, `[x]` fixed with a regression
test.

## D-001 `[ ]` Incoming message bubbles have no background at all

**Severity:** high. Every incoming message in the product, in both themes.

**Surface:** `artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx:927`, also
`:1134` and `artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/TypingIndicator.tsx:6`.

**Defect:** all three read `var(--kub-message-in)`. That custom property is
**never defined**. `artifacts/kub/src/index.css` defines `--kub-message-out` for
both themes (`:148` dark, `:281` light) and `--kub-surface` (`:131`, `:264`), but
there is no `--kub-message-in` anywhere in the repository. An undefined custom
property makes `background-color` resolve to nothing, so the bubble is
transparent and only its border remains.

**Evidence:** sampled from the captured light-theme phone preview —

| Sample | RGB |
| --- | --- |
| Chat wallpaper, empty area | `244, 248, 251` |
| Inside an incoming bubble | `244, 247, 253` |
| Inside an outgoing bubble | `130, 143, 157` |

The incoming bubble is indistinguishable from the wallpaper behind it; the
outgoing bubble, which uses a defined `color-mix` on `--kub-cyan`, is not.

**Consequence:** incoming messages read as text floating on the wallpaper inside
a thin outline rather than as bubbles. It is a large part of why the chat looks
unfinished. The selected-message highlight at `:1134` mixes against the same
undefined token, so selection is also weaker than intended.

## D-002 `[ ]` The bubble tail is a different colour from its own bubble and lands on the avatar

**Severity:** high. Every last-in-group message.

**Surface:** `artifacts/kub/src/index.css:433-456` (`.bubble-out::after`,
`.bubble-in::after`), applied at
`artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx:1130-1131`.

**Defect:** three problems in one element.

1. **Colour mismatch.** The incoming tail is filled with `--tg-message-in`,
   which `index.css:217` and `:350` alias to `--kub-surface` — a *defined*
   token. The bubble it belongs to is filled with the *undefined*
   `--kub-message-in` (D-001). The tail is therefore opaque while its own bubble
   is transparent. Sampled tail: `248, 252, 255` against a `244, 247, 253`
   bubble interior.
2. **It overlaps the avatar.** The tail is positioned `left: -8px` outside the
   bubble box, and the incoming avatar sits immediately to the left, so the
   triangle is drawn on top of the avatar circle.
3. **It has no border.** The bubble carries
   `border border-[color:var(--kub-border-color)]`; the tail is a bare CSS
   border-triangle, so the outline visibly breaks where the tail attaches.

**Consequence:** a light wedge that appears to overlap the bubble and clip into
the avatar. This is the element a reader notices first and cannot explain.
Reported by the user against the captured previews on 2026-09-01.

## D-003 `[ ]` The group read receipt is illegible at its rendered size

**Severity:** medium.

**Surface:** `artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx:828`.

**Defect:** the receipt renders Phosphor's `Checks` glyph
(`artifacts/kub/src/components/kub/icons.ts:228`) at `size={11}`. At that size
the two overlapping ticks merge into a pair of thin diagonal strokes that read
as a small arrow or a double slash rather than as checkmarks. The sibling
single-message delivery indicator on the same row uses `size={13}`
(`:806-814`), so two related indicators are drawn at different sizes.

**Consequence:** users cannot tell what the mark means. Reported by the user as
"a small arrow with no logical meaning" on 2026-09-01.

---

## D-004 `[ ]` The read count reads as a bare fraction with no unit or affordance

**Severity:** medium.

**Surface:** `artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx:817-831`,
label from `artifacts/kub/src/lib/groupReadReceipts.ts:62-65`.

**Defect:** the compact label is `${readCount}/${totalRecipients}`, rendered as
plain text immediately after a `tabular-nums` timestamp with a `gap-0.5`. It is
a `<button>` that opens the receipt list, but nothing about it looks
interactive. The accessible name is correct
(`groupReadReceipts.ts:67-72`, "Прочитано всеми: 3 из 3"), so the information
exists but only for assistive technology.

**Consequence:** a sighted user sees `15:02 ⁄⁄ 3/3` and cannot decode it, and
does not discover that it is clickable.

---

## D-005 `[ ]` The message meta row packs up to six elements without a hierarchy

**Severity:** low, but it is the general reason the bubble looks crude.

**Surface:** `artifacts/kub/src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx:794-840`.

**Defect:** the row can contain a pin icon (12 px), an "изм." label (10 px), the
timestamp (10 px, min-width `2.75rem`), then either a 13 px delivery icon or an
11 px icon plus a text fraction, then a 20 px actions button. Three different
icon sizes and two different type sizes sit at `gap-0.5` inside the bubble
padding, with no grouping.

**Consequence:** the densest part of the bubble is also the least organised, and
it is what the eye lands on after the message text.

## Notes on scope

D-001 and D-002 are single-token and single-rule fixes, but they change how
every message renders, so they need their own scoped change with visual
regression coverage rather than a drive-by edit inside an unrelated task. They
are also currently visible in the committed product previews, because those
previews render the shipping components and therefore faithfully reproduce the
defect. Regenerate the previews after fixing them.
